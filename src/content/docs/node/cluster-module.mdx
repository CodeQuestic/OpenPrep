title: Cluster Module
---

Node.js is inherently single-threaded, which means it processes one task at a time. This design can be a limitation for applications requiring heavy computation or high concurrency, as only one CPU core is utilized. The Cluster module addresses this by allowing you to fork multiple instances of your application that can run across multiple CPU cores.

## Significance

Clustering helps applications handle a larger number of requests efficiently by using the full processing power of a multi-core machine. Each cluster (or worker process) runs its own event loop and memory space, enabling the main application to scale horizontally. This is critical for CPU-bound tasks, making the Cluster module essential for high-performance Node.js applications.

## Setting Up Node.js Clusters

To maximize the performance of your Node.js applications, the Cluster module allows you to create multiple instances (or workers) that share the load across all available CPU cores.

1. **Import Modules**: Import the `cluster` and `os` modules to access the Cluster functionality and determine the system's CPU count.

   ```javascript
   const cluster = require("cluster");
   const os = require("os");
   ```

2. **Check for Master Process**: The master process is responsible for initializing and managing worker processes. To check if the current process is the master, use `cluster.isMaster`.

3. **Fork Workers**: Use `os.cpus().length` to get the number of CPU cores, then use `cluster.fork()` to create a worker process for each core.

4. **Set Up Worker Events**: Workers can handle HTTP requests or other tasks. Each worker can independently handle tasks or share the load with other workers.

5. **Monitor and Restart Workers**: To ensure reliability, listen for `exit` events from workers. If a worker crashes, the master process can restart it.

#### Example Code

Here’s an example of setting up a basic cluster with HTTP server workers:

```javascript
const cluster = require("cluster");
const http = require("http");
const os = require("os");

if (cluster.isMaster) {
  // Fork workers based on CPU core count
  for (let i = 0; i < os.cpus().length; i++) {
    cluster.fork();
  }

  cluster.on("exit", (worker) => {
    console.log(`Worker ${worker.process.pid} died. Restarting...`);
    cluster.fork();
  });
} else {
  // Workers handle HTTP requests
  http
    .createServer((req, res) => {
      res.writeHead(200);
      res.end("Hello from Node.js Cluster!");
    })
    .listen(8000);
}
```

## Load Balancing with Clusters

Node.js automatically balances the incoming load across worker processes in a cluster. Here’s how it works and some additional strategies you can use:

### Default Load Balancing

- Node.js uses a round-robin approach to distribute incoming connections among workers.
- The master process listens on a designated port, forwarding each connection to an available worker.

### Reverse Proxy Load Balancers

For larger applications, an external load balancer, like **Nginx** or **HAProxy**, can improve performance and manageability.

- **Benefits**: External load balancers offer advanced capabilities such as session management, request logging, SSL termination, and more.
- **Usage**: Set up a reverse proxy to distribute traffic to each instance of your Node.js application.

### Connection Sharing

Node.js supports connection sharing among workers, ensuring that requests are evenly distributed and that no single worker is overloaded.

- With connection sharing, the master process manages which worker receives each new connection, optimizing resource utilization across workers.

Using these load balancing techniques ensures that your application can handle high traffic and scales efficiently across multiple CPU cores.

## Inter-process Communication in Clusters

In a clustered Node.js environment, each worker process operates independently, but they may need to communicate with the master process or with each other. Here’s how to handle inter-process communication (IPC) effectively:

### Messaging System

- Workers communicate with the master process using `process.send()` to send messages and `process.on('message')` to listen for messages.
- Messages can be simple strings or complex data objects like JSON, enabling flexible data exchange between processes.

### State Sharing

Each worker runs in its own memory space, which means they don’t share memory directly. For real-time state sharing, an external service like **Redis** can serve as a central data store.

- **Redis** or similar in-memory databases help maintain a shared state, cache data, or coordinate tasks across workers.

### Common Use Cases

Inter-process communication is useful in scenarios where:

- **Cache Updates**: Workers need to inform each other of changes to a shared cache.
- **Task Coordination**: Workers coordinate tasks by communicating through the master process, ensuring efficient task distribution.

### Example Code

In the following example, a worker sends a message to the master, and the master listens for and logs this message:

```javascript
// Worker sends a message to the master
if (!cluster.isMaster) {
  process.send({ msg: "Hello from worker" });
}

// Master listens for messages from workers
cluster.on("message", (worker, message) => {
  console.log(
    `Master received message from worker ${worker.id}: ${message.msg}`
  );
});
```
